# inline

Inline line editor


## Non-goals and limitations

Inline is not intended to be a full readline-compatible replacement. It does not implement advanced features such as vi-style editing modes, history expansion, or complete Unicode grapheme width correctness across all terminals.

Instead, inline focuses on correctness for common modern terminal usage, while remaining lightweight and easy to embed.
